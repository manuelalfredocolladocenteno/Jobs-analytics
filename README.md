# Jobs-analytics

EasyApply Bot is a bot that helps you to apply to EasyApply offers on LinkedIn. Here is the project in case you are interested: https://github.com/nicolomantini/LinkedIn-Easy-Apply-Bot

Once you run this program every attempt to apply to a job gets recorded in a CSV file. I've been using the bot for a time and now I want to make some analytics in order to learn something new.

The notebook is auto explained, so just take a look.
